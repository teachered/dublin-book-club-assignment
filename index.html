Author Profile 

Umberto Eco, an Italian writer and philosopher who wrote some of the most influential works of the 20th century, died at the age of 84.
Eco was a master of semiotics, a branch of linguistics that studies the meaning of signs and symbols. 
His best-known work, "The Name of the Rose," is a medieval murder mystery set in a 14th-century monastery that is also a brilliant disquisition on the nature of truth. 
Eco's other novels include "Foucault's Pendulum," a labyrinthine conspiracy thriller, and "The Island of the Day Before," about a 17th-century sailor stranded on a deserted island.

In addition to his novels, Eco wrote numerous essays on literature, art, philosophy and politics. 
He was also a respected academic, serving as professor of semiotics at the University of Bologna for many years.

Eco was a man of wide-ranging interests and immense erudition. 
He was also a charming and witty companion, with a twinkle in his eye that hinted at the mischievous fun he took in subverting received wisdom.

He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.
